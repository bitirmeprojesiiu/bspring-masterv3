	<br /><br />
	<b>Mobile-specific information we collect</b>
	<br /><br />
	Most of the personally identifying information we collect is what you tell us about yourself. For example, certain of our products and services allow you to interact and share personal information and data with others. You choose what you want to share and how you want to share it.
	<br /><br />
	Certain information, including information you may consider personal to you, may be stored locally on the device using mechanisms such as mobile device storage. Please consult your device or client documentation on how to manage such local storage.
	<br /><br />

	<br /><br />
	<b>Uses</b>
	<br /><br />
	We use your information to process and personalize your requests. We also use the information for support, to develop new features, and to improve the overall quality of <b>Enroll</b> products and services.
	<br /><br />
	We may also use the information to show you a history of your activity, to provide you with statistics about you or your use of our product or service, or to provide you with a better user experience.
	<br /><br />
	If you purchase something through <b>Enroll</b> products and services, we may also use your information to bill you and to handle billing disputes.
	<br /><br />
	We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging fees and internet connection fees, will still apply.
	<br /><br />
	<b>Information sharing and onward transfer</b>
	<br /><br />
	We may share your information with certain third parties we use to perform certain functions, such as billing and text message or SMS delivery. These third parties will be required to treat your information in accordance with the applicable <b>Enroll</b> privacy policies. We may also share some information with your wireless operator in order to perform customer service functions.
	<br /><br />
	<b>Information we collect and how we use it</b>
	<br /><br />
	We will record information about your activity - such as posts you comment on and the other users with whom you interact - in order to provide you and other users with a better experience on <b>Enroll</b> services.
	<br /><br />
	We may also collect information about you from other users, such as when you come across with your friends.
	<br /><br />
	<b>Notifications.</b>
	<br /><br />
	Notifications may be sent to you, such as to notify of registration of an student, make a status updates, send a message to another user.
	<br /><br />
	<b>Information security</b>
	<br /><br />
	We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
	<br /><br />
	We restrict access to personal information to <b>Enroll</b> employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
	<br /><br />
	<b>Accessing and updating personal information</b>
	<br /><br />
	When you use <b>Enroll</b> services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. Please review the service Help Centers for more information.
	<br /><br />
